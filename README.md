# psat-lv-photometry

psat-lv-photometry is a repository for scripts used to measure photometry of transients discovered during a search for an optical counterpart to the first gravitational wave source discovered by LIGO (GW150914).  Imaging for the search was conducted primarily by Pan-STARRS1 with additional images from the NTT and LSQ.
